## EVE LoreMaster

### Overview
EVE LoreMaster, a free AI-powered service, provides interactive responses to queries about the sprawling and intricate backstory of EVE Online.

### Why?!
EVE Online boasts a rich, detailed universe teeming with politics, races, and events. Whether you're a new player trying to grasp the complexity of New Eden's history or a seasoned veteran wanting to dive deeper into the lore, navigating through this vast knowledge can be quite a hurdle. This is where EVE LoreMaster comes in! With its intuitive API, users can ask any question about the game's lore and get accurate answers instantly, helping them engage more deeply with the game's story, enhancing role-play experiences and overall immersion in the EVE universe.

### How?
Technically, EVE LoreMaster will work by applying advanced Natural Language Processing techniques powered by Machine Learning models to analyze and understand the corpus of EVE Online's lore documents. These ML models learn from large amounts of text data and are able to generate human-like text, making them perfect for answering questions about the game's lore. The APIs will allow developers to integrate LoreMaster easily into their own applications, tools or websites.

### Support
EVE LoreMaster would appreciate any support from the EVE community. As we continue to train our model to better understand the intricacies of EVE's lore, user testing and feedback is invaluable. Testing LoreMaster, asking it questions and reporting back any inaccuracies helps improve the tool dramatically. Additionally, accepting donations in the form of in-game currency enables us to fund the project, maintain the servers and continuously evolve LoreMaster to serve the community better. Together, we can make EVE LoreMaster a valuable resource for everyone in New Eden!

### Investment
I'm an experienced developed and will develop the application myself. The hosting cost of the service will be zero, with any real-life machine learning costs being funded by myself. I am asking for an ISK contribution of 10b ISK to work on this task instead of playing the game and generating my own ISK!

As an experienced developer, I'll personally handle the development of EVE LoreMaster, for free. Be assured that any real-money expenses (such as hosting and usage fees) will be absorbed by me, ensuring that the tool remains accessible for everyone. However, the hands-on nature of this project does mean less time engaging in-game and generating ISK. So, in lieu of that, your support through a contribution of 10b ISK would greatly help. This way, I would direct my efforts towards enhancing LoreMaster over in-game grinding. Your support allows me to make this project a priority and provides a means to aid its advancement.
